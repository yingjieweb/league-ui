League UI library for Web APP, built with Vue.js.

## Install
```
$ yarn add league-ui

or

$ npm install league-ui --save
```

## Note
This UI library will reset some styles as followed. I strongly recommend you to add these styles to all of your projects for saving time to find CSS bugs :)
```css
* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
